here is a second post, where I have remembered to change the file name as well as the name in the front matter. <em> AND</em> I remembered to include the .md file extension. How about trying some markdown formatting?

*nested in one asterisk*
**nested in two asterisks**

* carriage return, asterisk, space, text
